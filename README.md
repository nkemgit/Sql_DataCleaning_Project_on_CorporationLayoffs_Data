##Data Cleaning and Exploration for Layoffs Data Analysis using MySQL##

This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning and preparation for analysis using MySQL. The raw layoffs dataset, sourced from big_corporations.layoffs_data, was rigorously transformed to ensure high data quality and integrity. Key tasks performed included:

Creating a staging table to manage data workflow
Removing duplicate records to enhance data consistency
Standardising data formats for uniformity
Handling null values and blank rows to improve completeness
Removing irrelevant columns and rows to focus on essential data
Using MySQL, I applied techniques such as SQL Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, Number Functions, and Data Type Conversion to optimise the dataset for further analysis.

This project highlights my expertise in leveraging MySQL for advanced data exploration and cleaning, ensuring the data is accurate, reliable, and ready to support insightful analysis and decision-making.
